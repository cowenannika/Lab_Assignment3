#So for this one, you are going to start by putting in the number of strings you want to check, and then you enter each string line 
#by line! The output is then a list of column indicies showing where the columns are not sorted alphabetically. 
#The run time is O(n*n) because it uses two nested for loops with each loop itterating n times
#The space is O(n) because it uses an array to take the input of the user and store them in a string
